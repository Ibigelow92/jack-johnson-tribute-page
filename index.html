          <li>Both of his parents were slaves.</li>
          <li>Dropped out of school after five years, but learned to read and write.</li>
          <li>Became a janitor at a boxing gym at age 16 and trained in his free time.</li>
          <li>Won his first official match in 1898 against Charlie Brooks.</li>
          <li>Rose through the ranks, beating former champion Bob Fitzsimmons and the brother of the champion at the time, Jim Jefferies.</li>
          <li>Jim Jefferies retired, making way for a new heavyweight champion, Tommy Burns.</li>
